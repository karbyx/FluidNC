// Writing to non-volatile storage (NVS) can take a long time and interfere with timely instruction
// execution, causing problems for the stepper ISRs and serial comm ISRs and subsequent loss of
// stepper position and serial data. This configuration option forces the planner buffer to completely
// empty whenever the NVS is written, to prevent any chance of lost steps.
// It doesn't prevent loss of serial Rx data, especially if a GUI is premptively filling up the

// and wait for an 'ok' before sending more data.
// NOTE: Most setting changes - $ commands - are blocked when a job is running. Coordinate setting

// In old versions of Grbl, v0.9 and prior, there is a bug where the `WPos:` work position reported

// can be several motions behind. This option forces the planner buffer to empty, sync, and stop
// motion whenever there is a command that alters the work coordinate offsets `G10,G43.1,G92,G54-59`.

// By default, feed rate overrides are disabled for all G38.x probe cycle commands. Although this
